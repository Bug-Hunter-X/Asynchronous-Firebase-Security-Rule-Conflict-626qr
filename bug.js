The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to security rules and asynchronous operations:

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('/myData').once('value').then(snapshot => {
  const data = snapshot.val();
  // ... perform some action with data ...
  firebase.database().ref('/myData').update({newField: 'newValue'});
});
```

This code attempts to read data from the database, process it, and then update the same location. However, if the security rules for '/myData' are not configured correctly, an asynchronous issue can arise where the update operation fails even if the initial read was successful.  The problem is subtle because the initial read succeeds, masking the underlying security rule issue that would prevent the write.
